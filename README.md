# JavaScript Experiments
I created this repository to source control some experiments I
make with JavaScript. For example, I would implement well known
algorithms and data structures, for the matter of improving my
proficiency with the language and the concrete patterns.

# Why?
Because I love JavaScript and I want to become a language master.

# Tests
## Using the browser
Open the file `test/runner.html`

## From the terminal
Use `mocha-phantomjs` to run the runner.html. For this task you
should have `mocha-phantomjs` installed. You could install it with
`npm install mocha-phantomjs`.

Finally, run your tests with `npm test`.
